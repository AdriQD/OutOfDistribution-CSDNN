# CSDNN for out-of-distirbution state reconstruction


CSDNN is a protocol based on the combination of Compressed Sensing (CS) and a deep neural network model, to improve the performance of CS. The goal is twofolds:

1. obtain better reconstruction of pure random state using an incomplete amount of measurement outcomes. In our job we focused on 4 qubit random Haar states, and we employ just 30-45 observables in total, instead of 256 re

2. We want to extend the supervised denoising approach to a more general one, that would allow us to reconstruct states of unknwon mixedness. to achieve thie goal, we make use of the out-of-distirbution paradigm. By usig it, we study how well a pre-trained model, on pure states, can reconstruct state afflicted by depolarization noise.
