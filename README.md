# OutOfDistribution-CSDNN
An out-of-distribution approach for quantum state reconstruction with incomplete information.In this protocol, we combine supervised learning, based on a convolutional layers plus transformer encoder architecture, to improve the reconstructions of a mainstream compressed sensing algorithm.
